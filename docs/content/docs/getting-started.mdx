Getting started is pretty easy. First you need to figure out what variant you are using:

<Codesplit>
  <Codesplit.TRPC>
    Use this variant if you are using [TRPC](https://trpc.io) with their new [TanStack React Query
    integration](https://trpc.io/docs/client/tanstack-react-query)
  </Codesplit.TRPC>
  <Codesplit.ReactQuery>
    Use this variant if you are using [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/overview)
    directly
  </Codesplit.ReactQuery>
</Codesplit>

    Obviously that's not a lot of options. Other query libraries that are planned but I haven't implemented adapters for
    yet:
  </summary>
  - Tanstack Query with other frameworks:
    - [Vue Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/vue/overview)
    - [Solid Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/solid/overview) 
    - [Svelte  Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/svelte/overview)
    - [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/)
    - [RTK-Query](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/tutorials/rtk-query)
    - Maybe [react-query-kit](https://github.com/HuolalaTech/react-query-kit)? IDK, haven't looked into it deeply but seems like a good fit at first glance.
    - TRPC with other integrations besides TanStack React Query  integration](https://trpc.io/docs/client/tanstack-react-query) If any of these would be useful to you, please [let me know](/feedback)!
</details>

## 1 - Install the package:

<Codesplit>
  <Codesplit.TRPC>
    <NpmInstall packageName="@optimistic-updates/trpc" />
  </Codesplit.TRPC>
  <Codesplit.ReactQuery>
    <NpmInstall packageName="@optimistic-updates/react-query" />
  </Codesplit.ReactQuery>
</Codesplit>

## 2 - Setup the app-wide integration:

<Codesplit>
  <Codesplit.TRPC>
    If you followed [these instructions](https://trpc.io/docs/client/tanstack-react-query/setup#3a-setup-the-trpc-context-provider) when setting up your TRPC client, you probably have somewhere in your app where you are initializing a `QueryClient` object and subsequently a `trpcClient`  Find that place and add (after you create the `QueryClient` but before you create the `trpcClient`):
    ```
    const { engine, link } = optimisticEngineTRPC(queryClient);
    ```
    The `link` object is a TRPC compatible [link](https://trpc.io/docs/client/links) that will hook into the client and intercept network traffic.  It should be used to create the `trpcClient` like so:
    ```
      const trpcClient = createTRPCClient<AppRouter>({
        links: [
          link,
          /* ... Whatever other links you were already using ... */,
        ],
      });6
    ```
    The `engine` is used to inject optimistic updates.  It's probably a good idea to put this in a separate file because the logic could get rather large.  I would recommend making a file with an export like:
    ```
      export function addOptimisticUpdates(engine: OptimisticUpdateEngineTRPC, trpc: TRPCOptionsProxy<AppRouter>) {
        /* ... engine.inject calls go here ... */
      }
    ```
    And then after constructing the TRPC object, run:
    ```
      const trpc = createTRPCOptionsProxy<AppRouter>({
        /* (unchanged from normal TRPC setup) */
      });
      addOptimisticUpdates(engine, trpc);
    ```
    From here on out, you should be able to add any number of injections (`inject` calls) to the `addOptimisticUpdates` function.  You can organize these calls however you want.  They should only be called once on application startup.
  </Codesplit.TRPC>
  <Codesplit.ReactQuery>
    TODO Coming soon
  </Codesplit.ReactQuery>
</Codesplit>

## 3 - Implement your first injection

I can't give you the exact code to write for an injection because it's tied to your specific endpoints and I don't know those. However, here's what one might look like, you can adapt it to your needs:

<Codesplit>
  <Codesplit.TRPC>
    ```
      engine.inject({
        from: trpc.threads.delete,
        into: trpc.threads.all,
        transform(value, mutationState) {
          if (!value.find((x) => x.id === mutationState.input.id)) {
            return stopInjection;
          }
          return value.filter((x) => x.id !== mutationState.input.id);
        },
      });
    ```
  </Codesplit.TRPC>
  <Codesplit.ReactQuery>
    ```
      engine.inject({
        from: { mutationKey: ["threads", "delete"] },
        into: { queryKey: ["threads", "all"] },
        transform: (value: { id: number; title: string }[], mutationState: { input: { id: number } }) => {
          if (!value.find((x) => x.id === mutationState.input.id)) {
            return stopInjection;
          }
          return value.filter((x) => x.id !== mutationState.input.id);
        },
      });
    ```
  </Codesplit.ReactQuery>
</Codesplit>

## 5 - Further reading

YouInjections are the core of this library. Read [here](/guide/injections) for more information on what is possible with them. Other than that, cheers! You're done with setup :)
